# Solved Problems:

### Perform String Shifts

```
You are given a string s containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix shift, where shift[i] = [direction, amount]:

direction can be 0 (for left shift) or 1 (for right shift).
amount is the amount by which string s is to be shifted.
A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of s and append it to the end.
Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of s and add it to the beginning.
Return the final string after all operations.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation:
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:  
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"

```
```python
class Solution:
    def stringShift(self, s: str, shift: List[List[int]]) -> str:
        move_l = 0
        l_string = len(s)
        for i , j in shift:
            if i == 0:
                move_l = move_l+j
            else:
                move_l -= j
        move_l = move_l%l_string
        return s[move_l:] + s[:move_l]
```
### Single-Number
```
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)
```
### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        start, ans, chars = 0, 0, collections.defaultdict(int)
        for end in range(len(s)):
            start = max(start, chars[s[end]])
            ans = max(ans, end-start+1)
            chars[s[end]] = end+1
        return ans
```
### Regular Expression Matching
```
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.

'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
Example 1:

Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
Example 2:

Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
Example 3:

```
```python
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        s, p = ' '+ s, ' '+ p
        lenS, lenP = len(s), len(p)
        dp = [[0]*(lenP) for i in range(lenS)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        for j in range(1, lenP):
                if p[j] == '*':
                    dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-2]

        for i in range(1, lenS):
            for j in range(1, lenP):
                if p[j] in {s[i], '.'}:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                elif p[j] == "*":
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2] or int(dp[i-1][j] and p[j-1] in {s[i], '.'})

        return bool(dp[-1][-1])
```
